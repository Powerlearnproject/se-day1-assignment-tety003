Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
Software Engineering involves designing, developing. testing and maintaining software applications.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the tech industry by enabling the development of applications, websites, and AI-driven systems. Additionally, it is essential for cybersecurity, protecting sensitive data and digital infrastructures from cyber threats. Cloud computing services are built on software engineering principles to ensure scalability and reliability. 
It also enhances user experience by making applications more accessible and user-friendly. 
In sectors like healthcare and education, software engineering supports telehealth solutions, medical systems, and e-learning platforms.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
1. Early Programming Languages (1950s-1960s) – Languages like FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959)made programming more accessible by replacing complex machine code with human-readable syntax.  

2. Rise of Operating Systems (1960s-1970s) – The creation of UNIX (1969) introduced multi-user capabilities, file management, and a standardized development environment, shaping modern OSs.  

3. Internet & Open-Source Software (1990s-2000s) – The World Wide Web (1991) and open-source projects like Linux (1991) revolutionized software sharing, cloud computing, and collaboration.


**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 

1. Planning– Defining project goals, feasibility analysis, and resource allocation.  
2. Requirements Analysis – Gathering and documenting functional and technical requirements.  
3. Design – Creating system architecture, UI/UX design, and database structures.  
4. Implementation – Writing and developing the software based on design specifications.  
5. Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs through various testing methods (unit, integration, system testing).  
6. Deployment– Releasing the software for users, either as a full launch or phased rollout.  
7. Maintenance & Support – Updating, fixing issues, and improving performance post-release.



**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate**
- Waterfall follows a linear, step-by-step process, moving through phases like planning, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.  
- Agile is iterative and flexible, breaking the project into short development cycles called sprints.  
- Waterfall is rigid, with little room for changes once development starts, while Agile allows continuous adjustments.  
- Waterfall delivers the final product at the end, whereas Agile provides incremental updates throughout development.  
- Customer involvement is limited in Waterfall, but Agile encourages frequent feedback and collaboration.  
- Waterfall has higher risk due to late testing, while Agile reduces risks with ongoing testing and improvements.  
- Both aim for high-quality software and require teamwork, but Waterfall suits stable projects, while Agile is better for dynamic, evolving needs.

  Waterfall methodology can be used for large scale government projects like Healthcare systems eg. SHA while Agile methodology can be used for mobile app development having regular updates for the app.


**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team**

A *Software Developer* designs, codes, and maintains software by writing and optimizing code while fixing bugs. A *Quality Assurance Engineer* ensures software quality by creating test plans, identifying bugs, and verifying compliance with standards. A *Project Manager* oversees development by defining project scope, managing timelines, and ensuring successful delivery.

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
An IDE is a software suite that provides a centralized environment for writing, debugging, and testing code. It has features that make coding faster and reduce errors. Examples include Visual Studio Code and Eclipse, which help developers write and maintain high-quality code.  

A (VCS) enables teams to track changes, collaborate seamlessly, and maintain different versions of a project. It ensures code safety, rollback capabilities, and conflict resolution in team environments. Git, often used with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, is the most widely used VCS, allowing developers to merge changes, review code history, and work simultaneously without losing progress.  

**What are some challenges faced by software engineers. Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
-Rapid Technological advances may be difficult to keep up with. This can be countered by continuous learning through online courses, blogs.
-Bugs in codes. This can be fixed by use of debugging tools.
-Meeting deadlines-Prioritising tasks effectively can help in meeting deadlines



**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
 1.Unit Testing– Tests individual components or functions of a program to ensure they work as expected. It helps catch bugs early and ensures each module functions correctly before integration.  
2.Integration Testing– Ensures that different modules or services work together correctly after being combined. It helps identify communication errors between components.  
3.System Testing– Tests the entire application as a whole to validate that all components function correctly together. It ensures the software meets overall requirements.  
4.Acceptance Testing– Evaluates the software from the user's perspective to confirm it meets business needs and requirements. It is often the final step before deployment.  



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
Prompt engineering is the process of creating clear and effective instructions to get the best responses from AI models. It involves choosing the right words, giving enough details, and structuring questions properly to improve AI’s understanding.  
This is important because better prompts lead to better answers, making AI more useful and accurate.


**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
*Translate this sentence* is an example of a vague prompt
*Translate this sentence from English to French* is the improved prompt
It is more effective because it is clear on the language you want the sentence to be translated to.
